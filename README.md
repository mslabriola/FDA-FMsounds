# A Functional Data Anaysis approach for modelling frequency-modulated tonal sounds in animal communication
We propose the application of a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) approach to model frequency-modulation (FM) patterns, which entails the transformation of acoustic signals into continuous functions. 

Here we have created an intuitive Raven-to-R FDA workflow for modelling tonal sounds. Two potential applications for classification aims (functional clustering) and FM analysis in 
relation to contextual factors (functional regression) are shown. 

For illustrative purposes, we also supply data on FM patterns (contours) of signature whistles emitted by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), 
given their acoustic variability and potential information content. The available data is a subset of the data that was analysed in the publication.

The workflow is described in detail in Methods in Ecology and Evolution publication at: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14446
